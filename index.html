          <li><b>fostering trust</b> by building useful products with clear, accessible documentation;</li>
          <li><b>communicating effectively</b> to understand the needs of stakeholders before creating a realistic plan to address those needs.</li>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I've spent years working in a variety of professions -- from academic proofreading, to working professionally as a referee, to even dabbling in wine sales before, ultimately, finding my way to IT and systems engineering.</p>
      <p>If there's one thing that every role I've ever taken on has required, it's a certain human touch -- someone to identify and bridge gaps in knowledge, planning, and execution as they arise, and help make anyone from a client, to an executive, to an Olympic athlete feel that they're valued and understood.</p>
      <p>At the same time, as a lifelong tech enthusiast and longterm tech professional, I know firsthand the frustration and confusion that unclear errors, broken features, or a lack of accessibility can cause on a website or in an app. </p>
      <p>As an engineer, I want to be a part of the solution -- and help use technology to help build better tools and features for us all. </p>
